      You should use Skeleton if you're embarking on a smaller project or just
      don't feel like you need all the utility of larger frameworks. Skeleton
      only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but
      that's often more than enough to get started. In fact,
      <u>this site is built on Skeleton and has ~200 lines of custom CSS</u>
    </p>
  </div>
